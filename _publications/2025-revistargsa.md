  Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the cause-and-effect relationship between human activities and the
  intensification of natural disasters worldwide between 2020 and 2024, as well as the global
  challenge in public policy in this context. Scientific consensus confirms that human actions, such as the burning of fossil fuels,
  deforestation, and industrial processes, have significantly accelerated global warming,
  resulting in extreme weather events such as forest fires, floods, hurricanes, and prolonged droughts. Among the main results, we
  highlight the catastrophic fires in the Australian summer of 2019–2020 (“Black Summer”),
  the devastating floods in Europe (2021) and Pakistan (2022), among others. A survey of some natural disasters between 2020 and 2024
  was conducted, and how these were intensified by the consequences of anthropogenic
  actions was discussed. The research highlights the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, reinforcing the urgent need for
  integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies. The study advocates global cooperation,
  innovative policies, and sustainable practices to address the climate crisis. It is necessary to generate work to repair what the
  hegemonic model of the last century has degraded. This paradigm shift is incipient,
  and the country that applies to it before the others will have an advantage, since it will necessarily be developed and implemented
  through scientific and technological knowledge. This study contributes to the literature by establishing an intrinsic relationship
  between human activities and global climate change through empirical studies by authors/researchers.
