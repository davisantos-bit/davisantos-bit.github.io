abstract: |
  This paper provides a summary of the public policy scenario and the municipal public policy of the “Student Free Pass”, with urban
  mobility in Fortaleza-CE as the locus of study. In terms of methodology, we adopted a qualitative approach to research, as advocated
  by Lakatos and Marconi (2003), because it provides a state-of-the-art approach, providing this work with information related to the subject under investigation, which deals with public policies on urban mobility in Fortaleza-CE. In addition, the city of Fortaleza, in Ceará, exemplifies both the challenges and opportunities that urban mobility presents in Brazil. The city has undergone significant transformations in its infrastructure, reflecting a recognition of the importance of mobility for urban development. The proposal for future improvements to Fortaleza's public transport system, aligned with the concept of sustainable urban mobility, not only seeks to respond to current deficiencies, but also to ensure that the solutions are adaptable to the changes and demands of the population. Mobility in Fortaleza-CE is a mirror of how deficient public policies are for the population, not just in the context of the capital of Ceará, but in the complexity of the cycle of public policies inherent to urbanization and mobility in many capitals and major cities in the interior of the country, some less problematic than others, but all with some resolution to be taken to improve people's lives in terms of locomotion.
