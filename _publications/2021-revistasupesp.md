abstract: |
  Public security requires integrated and multidimensional solutions, as no single measure is capable of producing lasting results. In
  this context, the coordinated action of law enforcement agencies, the justice system, and public policies in the areas of education,
  health, social inclusion, and employment and income generation is essential. In the State of Ceará, the Secretariat of Public Security
  and Social Defense (SSPDS) adopts a strategy based on the triad of intelligence, investigation, and ostensive policing, with
  integration as a guiding principle. Ostensive policing is strengthened through the combination of traditional policing and community
  based policing, which underpins the implementation of the State Program for Territorial Protection and Risk Management (Proteger). The
  program operates through the installation of fixed bases of the Ceará Military Police in micro-territories with high rates of crimes
  against life, ensuring continuous police presence at strategic locations. The observed results indicate a reduction in violent crime
  rates in these areas, highlighting the relevance of Proteger as an effective instrument for violence prevention and control.
