abstract: |
  The study presents a mapping of the concentration of firms and economic activities at the neighborhood level, according to the CNAE
  2.0 classification and based on data from the Annual Social Information Report (RAIS) of the Ministry of Labor for the year 2012. The
  study also provides a comparative analysis between the concentration of firms and the quality of life of the population residing in
  the neighborhoods. This model is based on the hypothesis that there is a positive linear relationship between the Human Development
  Index, specifically its income dimension (HDI-Income), and the Aggregate Concentration Index by neighborhood (ACI-n), measured for the
  neighborhoods of Fortaleza. This document becomes a valuable instrument for public policies aimed at increasing the competitiveness of
  economic sectors most relevant to the development and growth of neighborhoods in the capital city, as well as for combating and
  reducing existing income inequalities among neighborhoods.
