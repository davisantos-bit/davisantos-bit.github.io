abstract: |
  This paper deals with the female prison system in the state of Ceará, in its intrinsic issues regarding the social situation of women in prison. Therefore, explaining this theme encourages the promotion of the Democratic Rule of Law, in its human rights, respect and equality, and social justice. In this context, historically we have been faced with the difficulty of access to fundamental rights, which has been a latent problem in its broadest sense, and an obstacle to the exercise of citizenship. In fact, only small groups are able to access and enforce the minimum rights that belong to each of us, simply by knowing them and how to activate them. In general terms, when we move into the sphere of individual and collective daily life, we see a greater complexity, since we observe the distance between what is established in our Magna Carta and the concrete practice experienced. In the specific case of those who are considered minorities—and here we are talking about groups of women in conditions of imprisonment—we see the complete absence of basic notions about their fundamental rights. In addition to this double situation of gender and imprisonment, there are others that make their condition as offenders more penalized and suffered than it should be, due to the fact that they are poor, live in peripheral neighborhoods, are semi-literate, black or brown, self-employed or unemployed (Pordeus; Santos; Fernandes, 2023). In short, these issues will be explained throughout this study, which specifically demonstrates and problematizes the Auri Moura Costa Women's Penal Institute (IPF) in the state of Ceará.
