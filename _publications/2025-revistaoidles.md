abstract: |
  This paper discusses social movements and popular education in rural areas in Latin America, in the context of hegemony and the people participating in the scenario. In this context, we know that rural areas have been considered and discussed from many perspectives, including food production, agroecology, sustainability, and education, and, in this regard, reflections in this area are highlighted in the current educational situation we are experiencing, in which we discuss various social issues, including rural education, which involve generations, struggles, and sacrifices of a people for the land, which has a diatopic character and goes beyond our original ancestors in Latin America. Indeed, it is well known that the territory now known as Latin America is a space marked by struggles and resistance, a territory that has a striking and well-established duality between the dominated and the dominant throughout its history. This duality explicitly shows us the construction of a dominant European capital hierarchy, subjugating those who differed from the subjugated in the most diverse aspects imaginable (language, beliefs, customs, and values). These struggles are intrinsically linked to the colonizing process established here, triggering a range of resistance to such domination, bringing with it a character of rebellion and confrontation to those who had and have their rights denied by the hegemonic ruling state.
