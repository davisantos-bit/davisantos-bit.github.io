abstract: |
  This essay deals with the subject of social protection in Brazil. To this end, we make a specific historical cut and discuss its
  significance in contemporary times. In addition, with regard to social protection systems, it is possible to verify, throughout
  historiography, that it is unlikely that any society could sustain itself without any kind of protection, to the point that the
  individuals of these collectives would be destitute even while the social contract was being established. From this context, we
  address the social protection system in Brazil, in its historical formation and contemporary diachrony, since it is relevant to
  establish a chronology and discuss the premises of social protection on a political and social basis. In this context, before we go
  into the points relating to social protection, let's go back to the first idea of the formation of the state in Rousseau's Social
  Contract. In his work, the author raises the idea that society will only be harmonious in its “social peace” to the extent that there
  is an exchange of favors between citizens and the state, which will provide social and legal security and social peace, to the
  detriment of those who have renounced their individual freedoms in favor of decisions in this direction, thus promoting justice.
