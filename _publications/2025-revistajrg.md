abstract: |
  The judicialization of healthcare is understood as another part of the history and struggle between society and the State to guarantee
  the right to healthcare in Brazil, as enshrined in the 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The judicialization of
  healthcare is the use of lawsuits to secure the resolution of political conflicts and controversies regarding norms, resolutions, and
  public policies adopted or implemented by the Executive and Legislative branches. The State, ineffective in fulfilling its role of
  formulating and managing public policies, provides an opportunity for judicial intervention by determining the allocation of funds
  allocated and used for the purchase of medicines, hospitalizations, and hospital procedures for patients in private hospitals, through
  lawsuits. Indeed, this study combines law and public policy in a single research theme, given that these areas are intrinsic to the
  intention of increasing constitutional prerogatives for healthcare users in Brazil.
