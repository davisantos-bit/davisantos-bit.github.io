abstract: |
  Economic development is influenced by multiple factors, among which the educational profile of the population plays a central role. In
  an economy increasingly driven by innovation and knowledge generation, high-quality education is essential for national
  competitiveness and social development. The literature broadly agrees that education improves socioeconomic indicators, particularly
  by enhancing workforce quality, productivity, technological absorption, and innovation capacity. Understanding the educational profile
  of a region enables policymakers to design targeted public policies, align local labor supply with firms’ educational requirements,
  and promote a more balanced spatial distribution of economic activities. This study analyzes the educational profile of Fortaleza’s
  population at the neighborhood level using educational development indicators produced by the Municipal Secretariat for Economic
  Development (SDE). Additionally, it identifies the economic sectors that generate the most employment according to the level of
  education required, highlighting implications for local development, employment generation, and urban mobility.
