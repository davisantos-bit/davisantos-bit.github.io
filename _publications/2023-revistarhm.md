abstract: |
  This paper approaches violence and crime in their multiple contemporary scenarios, covering the regional, national, and international
  spheres. To this end, this study constitutes a literature-based essay grounded in the academic research of Barth (2019), incorporating
  contributions from other scholars in public policy and public security as participating agents in the expansion of analytical
  perspectives on the theme. According to Fontgalland (2022), the multisemiosis inherent in violence and crime is present in the daily
  lives of citizens, leading to persistent feelings of fear, insecurity, and anxiety. Moreover, in order to address the scope of these
  phenomena, the author emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on related fields such as psychology,
  biology, and sociology, among others. According to Bernasco and Elffers (2010, apud Barth, 2019), issues related to the study of
  criminality exhibit an anachronistic character, given their timeless relevance in social debate. Regarding methodology, this study
  focuses on a literature review of crime in Brazil, with a spatial perspective and specific attention to data obtained from the
  academic work Modeling the Patterns of Crime in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The objective was to investigate the demographic and
  regional factors affecting the incidence of violence and criminality in Brazil. The findings indicate that publications on crime in
  Brazil incorporating spatial analysis are both current and central to understanding the contemporary configuration of violence in its
  various forms and contexts. Furthermore, exploring this field enables a deeper understanding of social space, as well as the
  motivations behind crime and its consequences for victims and the most vulnerable populations.
