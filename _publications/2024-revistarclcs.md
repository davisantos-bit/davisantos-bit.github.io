abstract: |
  Social education is a field of work that develops the capacities of people who lack resources and including them in a system that discriminates against and suppresses human beings is a task that encourages the promotion of citizenship and human rights. In this context, we sought to focus our research on the Pirambu neighbourhood, as it has numerous social organizations that can explain the population's potential and needs in the context of Social Education. In fact, we used the context of the Emaús Association, located in this neighborhood, as an example of the social work carried out there, since it is a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) that provides basic social protection services and programs for children and adults. Our methodology is based on a qualitative approach, using bibliography on the subject and documents that support Social Education in the world of work. In short, we concluded that the representation of social education is essential for identifying the real problems faced by people living in the Pirambu neighborhood, such as poverty, violence, unemployment and discrimination in the locality. In this sense, there is a need to increase the rates of people's social conditions for possible improvements through public policies on education, employment and income, health and safety for the residents of the neighborhood, given that there is only the Emmaus Movement to meet social demands, and even so, it does not dispel the social ills faced by the population of greater Pirambu.
