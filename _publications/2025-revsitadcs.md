abstract: |
  This study analyzes the spatial distribution of homicides and their socioeconomic determinants in 113 neighborhoods in Fortaleza (CE)
  between 2010 and 2021. Using spatial analysis techniques and econometric models such as SAR and SEM, it identifies significant spatial
  dependence in homicide rates, with evidence of agglomeration in socially vulnerable areas. The work shows that variables such as the
  seizure of firearms and the Human Development Index (HDI) directly influence the dynamics of lethal violence. By combining spatial
  statistics with the foundations of criminological theory, especially the Social Disorganization Theory, the study offers a territorial
  diagnosis of urban crime. The results provide support for evidence-based public policies and broaden the understanding of how urban
  space and structural inequalities shape local patterns of violence. Furthermore, the empirical data from this study consistently
  demonstrates that the distribution of homicides in Fortaleza does not occur randomly, but according to well-defined spatial patterns,
  revealing clusters of high violence concentrated in areas with low socioeconomic conditions.
