abstract: |
  Sexual violence is a complex issue, predominantly affecting women, children, and adolescents, requiring multifaceted responses. This study evaluated the health regionalization policy in Ceará as a foundation for creating a care network for victims.
  It employed In-Depth Evaluation to analyze health regionalization, considering territorial and temporal aspects of sexual crimes, combining documentary and statistical research. The results show that Ceará has public services for victim assistance,
  indicating the feasibility of integrated action among security, justice, and social assistance sectors. However, sexual violence is not explicitly prioritized in regional health plans, highlighting the need for its inclusion. Between 2009 and 2023,
  26,801 victims were recorded in the state, with peaks in 2013 and 2019. The predominant profile is female, under 19 years old, of mixed race (parda), and with incomplete primary education, reflecting the vulnerability of this group. Essential elements
  were proposed to strengthen the victim care network, considering regional specificities, based on the Casa Civil’s Ex-Ante Analysis Guide and the Health Care Network model. This research aims to contribute to more effective public policies in combating
  sexual violence in Ceará, using health regionalization as a strategy to adapt responses to the state’s territorial needs.
