abstract: |
  The judicialization of healthcare is understood as another part of the history and struggle between society and the State to guarantee the right to healthcare in Brazil, as enshrined in the 1988 Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil. The judicialization of healthcare is the use of lawsuits to secure the resolution of political conflicts and controversies regarding norms, resolutions, and public policies adopted or implemented by the Executive and Legislative branches. The State, ineffective in fulfilling its role of formulating and managing public policies, provides an opportunity for judicial intervention by determining the allocation of funds allocated and used for the purchase of medicines, hospitalizations, and hospital procedures for patients in private hospitals, through lawsuits. Indeed, this study combines law and public policy in a single research theme, given that these areas are intrinsic to the intention of increasing constitutional prerogatives for healthcare users in Brazil.


This study adopted a spatial analytical approach to examine the distribution of the Violent Lethal Intentional Crimes (CVLI) in the urban area of Caucaia, using the R programming language and specialized libraries. The Moran's I, Geary's C and Monte-Carlo tests highlighted strong patterns of spatial autocorrelation, indicating the presence of spatial clusters in crime rates. Local analysis with LISA Cluster Map identified areas of high concentration ('High-High') and adjacencies with areas classified as ('High-Low'). The spatial intersection of these areas revealed that 31.9% of the 897 CVLI cases occurred in the identified clusters, representing only 3.93% of the total area. This emphasizes the need for specific strategies in these regions. The results have the potential to contribute to public policies, allowing for the effective allocation of resources and the implementation of preventive measures. Continuing the study is crucial for a more comprehensive understanding, involving temporal analyzes and consideration of socioeconomic factors, contributing to the development of informed and comprehensive strategies to tackle the structural roots of crime in the region.
