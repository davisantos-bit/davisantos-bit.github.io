	This study investigates criminality in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará, using police incident reportsto conduct a clustering analysis, which identified the existence of a kind of insecurity belt in thecity. This insecurity belt is composed of neighborhoods that exhibit high crime rates, such ashomicides, robberies, and thefts. The neighborhoods forming this zone are located in peripheralregions of the city, characterized by low income and poor infrastructure. Subsequently, PrincipalComponent Analysis was employed to reduce the data dimensionality, revealing that the mainfactors related to criminality are poverty and low education.  The complexity of the problemrequires integrated public policies to address it, focusing on the aforementioned factors.  Theresults provide a detailed view of the criminal dynamics in Fortaleza, revealing that more affluentareas are often surrounded by regions with high crime levels, forming an insecurity belt.
