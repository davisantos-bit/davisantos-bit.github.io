abstract: |
  The approach to urban space associated with the places where the main crime indicators occur is becoming increasingly important in
  criminology studies, and has recently emerged as a key focus in crime theory, prevention practices and, above all, in the spatial
  analysis of public security policies. The aim of this paper is to investigate a structural model of violent crime in the urban
  perimeter of the municipality of Caucaia, Ceará, Brazil. The results point to an increase in the spatial concentration of the
  escalation of V&C in the territory of Caucaia, evidence of which shows that the escalation of V&C in the municipalities of the
  Metropolitan Region of Fortaleza, not only presents a temporal distribution and dynamic, but also a heterogeneous spatial distribution
  and dynamic, which calls for a critical reflection on the model of urban development in force in Brazil and the importance of building
  a fair, democratic and inclusive public security policy.
