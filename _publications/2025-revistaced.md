  This study evaluates the relation and extracurricular factors—gender, race, social class, geographic region, and school system (public and private)—on the performance of elementary school students in Brazil between 1999 and 2017. Ordinal logistic regression is used as an empirical econometric method, and along the distribution of students' proficiencies in two phases of elementary school: 4th grade/5th grade and 8th grade/9th grade. For the empirical verification, 20 SAEB/Prova Brasil microdata bases were used, totaling 3,851,542 students. The results show that females perform better than males in elementary school. Grizzly and yellow students have unfavorable tendencies towards higher reading proficiency levels in 4th grade/5th grade and favorable tendencies in 8th grade/9th grade. Black students have higher chances of lower reading proficiency in both cycles of elementary school.
